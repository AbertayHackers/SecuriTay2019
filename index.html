            <p class="text-faded">Securi-Tay has been a great success over the many years it has been running and it keeps getting bigger and better each year, even being included on several must-attend infosec conference lists. This year will be the 8th year that Securi-Tay is being run, and it is currently the biggest student-run infosec conference in Europe. What started as a way to get society members involved and engaged with the infosec community has grown into a popular conference which attracts around 350 attendees from a mixture of industry and academic backgrounds.</p>
            <p class="text-faded">Securi-Tay offers many advantages for both attendees and sponsors. For attendees, included in the ticket is a day of high-quality talks from a range of industry professionals as well as the chance to network with other attendees and sponsors (plus, our world-famous hog roast). Thanks to our high level of student engagement, attending Securi-Tay offers excellent recruitment opportunities for any sponsors looking to network with potential interns and graduates.</p>
            <p class="text-faded"><b>This year the conference will be run on Friday 1st March at Abertay University.</b></p>

                      <h4>Software Security: Never Stop Evolving</h4>
                      <p class="abstract">From the early days of software bugs through to the modern day, software security practitioners have had to adapt to a cascade of paradigm shifts. As technology has increased in complexity, so have the attack vectors. Not only have we played cat and mouse with the attackers and their evolving attacks, but we’ve had to adapt to how software development has gone from Waterfall to Agile to DevOps.<br><br>As security finally appears to have won enough credibility to be given a voice in software development, there are opportunities and risks. In this talk, I will focus on software security specifically, some of its history, the current challenges, and how you as a security subject matter expert can help shape its future.</p>

                  <p class="abstract">Microsoft has slowly been introducing tools to help organisations better manage and troubleshoot Windows performance and issues; these are now entirely integrated into Windows. To improve performance and troubleshooting capabilities, Microsoft introduced System Resource Usage Monitor (SRUM) in Windows 8 and beyond. PowerShell has become the default “command line” management tool for windows administrators. These tools provide both a wealth of information into what has happened and is present on the system. For Forensics and even Incident Response, these tools are now a go to built-in option to bootstrap and drive the forensics process including opening access to artefacts that overzealous user or even a “smart” attacker has removed. SRUM for instance can provide data points ranging from network to process activitiy providing insight into what, who, when and how an attacker or malicious process introduced itself into the environment. This talk will help the participant build the foundations to identify which built in tools can assist in the Windows Forensics process and the data points that are available as well as examine how services such as SRUM can be used to extract key data points to provide information for incident response or threat hunting activities.</p>

                  Everyone and their dog is aware of macro based malware nowadays, but not all know that PDFs can also contain malicious payloads and be used to execute them. Although many anti-virus systems can detect malicious PDFs, basic obfuscation techniques can be applied to fool even the crème de la crème of these systems. In this talk I will discuss the fundamentals of PDFs, how several obfuscation techniques work, how they can be implemented, and their effectiveness (or lack thereof) at evading anti-virus systems.<br><br><b>Talk 2: GPU Accelerated Security</b><br>Since the introduction of general purpose graphics processing units, many trivially scalable tasks have benefitted from GPU acceleration. However, open source security projects have lagged behind, and those that have tried to implement GPU acceleration (such as suricatta) have failed to do it well. This talk takes a brief look at when GPU acceleration should be used, what it is good for, what the caveats are, and how it can be applied to security tools/applications. Accelerating security tools such as IDS and Hard Drive Forensics through GPU optimization.</b><br> </p>

Sure, you need some hardware to talk to hardware, but that shouldn't be a barrier to entry. The cost of a couple pints is enough to get a device to help you. I'll demonstrate 7 different cases where you can use an FT232H-based board or cable to pull off a hardware hack, including: <br>- Getting a root shell over a UART <br>- Modifying I2C configuration of a device <br>- Sniffing a hardware bus as a Logic Analyzer <br>- Dumping flash off a device for offline analysis <br>- Backdooring firmware and flashing it to a device <br>- Jtag debugger <br>- Replaying custom crafted protocol packet <br>Hopefully you'll come away with the confidence and know-how to tackle a hardware attack of your own.</p>

This talk will help you become familiar with the role generic malware plays in the world of not-so-sophisticated threat actors, how it's built and what job it's designed to do.

              What does Minority Report, Black Mirror, and 1984 all have in common?.. Well, turn up to the talk to find out. On a day to day basis we countlessly write notes, send messages and respond to emails. The question is, however, what does what we write actually show about us, and how can we use the meaning behind these pieces of text to predict crimes and attacks. This talk delves into just this - how machine learning, and specifically natural language processing and sentiment analysis, can be used to predict crime and security attacks. This, of course, comes hand in hand with talking about predictive policing approaches, biases in predictive policing, and how natural language processing can be used to automate this whole process.<br><br><b>Talk 2: Using Natural Language Processing Techniques to Crack Passwords</b><br>A custom dictionary that exploits the shared social experience of a userbase can be interactively built by making multiple cracking passes through a hash dump, and on each pass adding other similar words to the dictionary. We might crack one user's password that is based on a local football team and another based on an anime character but if we can add all the other regional football teams and other anime characters to the dictionary for the next cracking pass, we are likely to discover that other users share similar interests. Here we explore the use of Natural Language Processing models for automatically discovering candidate words for a custom password cracking dictionary.</p>

          <p class="abstract">There are many Software Defined Radios (SDRs) available, with a great
            deal of time and effort having gone in to their design.  These are not
            those radios.  I present four radios that we have designed using crude,
            novel, and sometimes ridiculous methods for transmitting and receiving
            signals. <br>The arrival of SDR allowed more hackers than ever to experiment with
            radio protocols, but we're still using hardware built by other people.
            In the time honored hacker tradition of rolling our own tools, we'll
            demonstrate four simple radios that can be home-built using commonly
          available parts for little to no cost.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the past, I've built a number of challenges for a variety of events. I've always tended towards the more physical side of things. It's remarkably hard to second guess the skill level of potential players, and to build something that hits the fine balance between being achievable without being too easy, when given competitors of varying ability. Sometimes things go well, sometimes, almost comically less so. I'll give some examples of games I've built in the past, the approaches I took when designing them, and some lessons learnt actually getting people stress testing them in the real world...</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mobile application security isn't always super exciting or challenging but when it comes to application hardening things get more interesting. These days, it is not uncommon for particular types of application to go out of their way to defend themselves at runtime. Such application types would include but are not limited to:<br>- financial apps<br>- multiplayer games<br>- apps which feature DRM protected content<br>- apps with intellectual property etc. <br>It's often the case that such applications attempt to protect themselves via internally developed controls, as well as leveraging commercial products. During this talk we'll look at some of the typical controls that Android/iOS applications exhibit, how they work, how to spot them, and how to sidestep them. We’ll be demonstrating analysis and techniques using free open source tooling such as Radare, Frida, and for some parts we’ll also leverage IDA Pro. Since automation is the buzzword of the year too we’ll also be discussing how to automate some of these activities that typically take up most of the assessment window.</p>

We glorify and revel in impressive and amusing social engineering hijinks, which is great until the point where we need to get our colleagues to be better about security behaviours and the first “soft skills" that we think of using in the context of security are about deception and manipulation. Social engineering can be powerful for getting people to do things for you, but helping people to be better with security practices requires a different approach to be effective. This talk will cover some basics tips from teaching and behaviour change interventions, which skills developed in the context of social engineering have some crossover, and pitfalls with using social engineering tactics on your coworkers.<br><br><b>Talk 2: Intro to Machine Learning for Hackers</b><br>As cyber security students & professionals, do we really need to care about Machine Learning? In this talk we will go over what machine learning is, what it can do, and how it can (and can't) help the cyber security profession. After taking a deep dive into a particular algorithm, where we will learn a bit of maths and logic behind how ML works, will focus on: examining how the industry is currently utilising it (ML for phishing detection, ML for NIDS and ML for SIEM), how adversaries could use it to our disadvantage and how Machine Learning is vulnerable to attack itself.</p>

Whilst the threat models enabled by this should be quite familiar to anyone securing a heterogeneous Windows network, they may not be as well understood by a typical UNIX admin who does not have a strong background in Windows and AD. Over the last few months I've spent some time looking a number of specific AD integration solutions (both open and closed source) for UNIX systems and documenting some of the tools, tactics and procedures that enable attacks on the forest to be staged from UNIX.</p>

          <p class="abstract">Do you think users are the weakest link in the security chain? Here is some duct tape to change that, and to raise the bar for social engineers and other attackers alike. Over the last few decades, sysadmins and people working in IT have called users names and generally rolled their eyes at the antics of those allegedly lazy, stupid and uneducated people. From PEBKAC to ID-Ten-T we have been calling them names and didn't want them on our networks. This way of destructive thinking needs an overhaul, and here are some easy tricks how users can become the valuable asset in corporate security that indeed they should be. Finding creative solutions to existing problems has been a standard skill for red teamers, whereas those defending networks often rely on standards. Discover some creative solutions people have come up with to significantly raise their security - most of them are easy to implement - and how users can become a major asset of any security team.</p>

        <p class="abstract"><b>Talk 1: It might get loud! Exfiltrating data using audio interfaces</b><br>Data exfiltrating is often the final and most important phases of an attack as this is when the target data is actively stolen and transmitted across network boundaries. However, on restricted and isolated environments, this stage becomes more challenging as avenues for data to be transferred are drastically reduced, and it is quite common for removable storage devices to be disabled. How about using devices that are usually permitted such as sound cards to exfiltrate the data? Turning files into analogue signals is not a novel idea, modems did this many years ago... but how about using a USB soundcard to transfer files from a computer to another device? When classical methods fail, jazz it up and rock it out! (This can involve very low or high frequency sounds).<br><br><b>Talk 2: Back to School: Bringing it Back to the Students</b><br>This talk will discuss tools, tricks and stories from students on how to advance yourself and get a foothold in the infosec industry.
